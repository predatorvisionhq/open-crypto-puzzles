# Negatives ledger, Arweave Puzzle #3

Every run used the certified oracle (SHA-512 x11513, AES-OpenSSL decrypt, `"kty":"RSA"`
gate). None of these runs carries a planted witness inside its own candidate space, since
the correct answer is unknown; the oracle itself is certified separately against the
solved sibling Arweave #8 (see the README's "Certified against" section). Dated 2026-06-22
unless noted otherwise.

| # | Configuration | Candidates | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| B1 | Top-12 uncertain readings, hedged anchors | 332,000 | 0 match |
| B2 | Free-slot diagnostic: each of the 8 slots freed alone over `[a-z0-9]^4`, other 7 at top-1 reading | 8 x 1,680,000 = 13,440,000 | 0 match in all 8 runs |
| B3 | Free slot 1, with contested anchors (slot 5 = a year, slot 7 = a different word, slot 8 = a literal count) | 1,680,000 | 0 match |
| B4 | Free slots 1, 2, 8 with an extended charset (symbols and digits added) | 2,080,000 | 0 match |
| B5 | 4 anchors locked, 4 uncertain slots swept with complete wordlists | 1,800,000 | 0 match |
| B6 | One anchor (slot 3, 5, 7, or 8) relaxed at a time over a full list, the other 7 locked | approximately 25,000,000 to 31,000,000 each, 4 configurations | 0 match |
| B7 | All 8 slots, top-8 candidates each (early wordlists) | 16,700,000 | 0 match |
| B8 | Word-order permutations of one 8-word set (the original best-guess reading) | 8^8 = 16,777,216 | 0 match |
| B9 | Word-order permutations of a second 8-word set (revised reading) | 8^8 = 16,777,216 | 0 match |
| B10 | 2 anchors locked, 6 uncertain slots swept with enriched wordlists (round 2) | 2,270,000 | 0 match |
| B11 | All 8 slots, top-6 candidates each (consolidated wordlists) | 1,680,000 | 0 match |
| B12 | All 8 slots, top-8 candidates each (consolidated wordlists) | 16,700,000 | 0 match |
| B13 | All 8 slots, top-10 candidates each (consolidated wordlists) | 100,000,000 | 0 match |
| B14 | Grammar-filtered top-4 reading (proper-noun-style additions) | 65,000 | 0 match |
| B15 | Word-order permutations of a third 8-word set (grammar-filtered reading) | 8^8 = 16,777,216 | 0 match |
| B16 | Word-order permutations of the same set, alternate tie-break | 8^8 = 16,777,216 | 0 match |
| B17 | Slot 5 `{e4d5, 1984}` × slot 8 `{base, dots}`, with the six documented anchors fixed (2026-08-16); head/middle/tail coverage probes only, not a positive witness | 2 x 2 = 4 | 0 match (uncertified: no known-good control was re-found through the runner) |
| B18 | Slot 1 `{weve, a16z, anno}` × slot 5 `{e4d5, 1984}` × slot 7 `{pull, vest, pool}` × slot 8 `{base, dots}`, with slots 2/3/4/6 fixed as `md12/a384/cash/root`; `tools/slot1_slot5_slot7_slot8_product.py` using `oracle.check`, with positive sibling control re-found through that check path; measured rate 1 / 4.21 s = 0.2375 candidates/s, N/D = 151.56 s (2026-08-16) | 3 x 2 x 3 x 2 = 36 total; 32 novel after deducting B17's 4-member overlap | 0 match in 105.54 s; head/middle/tail coverage probes also 0 match |


Also refuted, not a candidate sweep: forensic steganalysis of all 8 rebus images and the
page itself (exiftool, binwalk, `zsteg -a`) found no LSB payload, no appended bytes, no
metadata payload, and no discrepancy in the alpha channel. This is a pure visual rebus.

Also refuted: Norse mythology as a reading for slot 5 (checked against the Discord export's
683 messages from the author; every apparent reference is to a project codename, not
mythology). Also refuted: `sha3`/Keccak as a reading for slot 3 (the drawn glyph and the
author's own hash-size discussion point to SHA-384, not SHA-3). Also refuted: Base58 as
Arweave's own on-chain address encoding (Arweave addresses use base64url; a "Base58" OTC
trading desk that was active in the author's Discord in early 2019 remains a candidate
source for that slot's 4-character token).

Cumulative: on the order of 330,000,000 candidates tested against the current best-guess
readings, 0 matches. The oracle and mechanism are not in question; what remains unresolved
is which of the 8 image readings are still wrong.
