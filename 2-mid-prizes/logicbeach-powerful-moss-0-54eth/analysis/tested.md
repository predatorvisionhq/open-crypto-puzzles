# Tested (full negatives ledger)

Every derivation row uses `tools/oracle.py`: a candidate only counts as a match if the derived
ETH address equals the winner wallet `0x635739254BDE27d28301f25aD57c3cAC3C3468f3` exactly,
under any of the 9 swept BIP44 paths (3 accounts times 3 indexes). Witness: the oracle's own
`--selftest` reproduces the public BIP39 KAT address, a positive control that points the oracle
at the KAT's own address, a negative control against the real winner wallet, an invalid-checksum
rejection, and the artist's prior solved "Bifurcations" BIP84 vector, before every run below.

## Audio channel (the toolbox that solved the artist's prior puzzle, "Bifurcations")

| Hypothesis | Space | Method | Result | Witness | Date |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Spectrogram text, Morse (kick/snare as dash/dot), SSTV (including invert-merge), theme-keyed hex offsets, LSB and bit-plane analysis, RIFF/XMP metadata, mid-side decoding, sub-20Hz content, small and medium ASR, demucs vocal isolation plus ASR, run on all 12 lossless masters | 12 tracks times the full toolbox | the same toolbox that solved "Bifurcations" (2020) | negative on all 12 tracks | yes (the toolbox is confirmed to work, since it is what solved the prior puzzle) | 2026-06-17 |

The masters themselves measure at close to 0 percent energy above 13 kHz, which is a property
of the recording, not a playback or re-encoding artifact, so no high band exists to carry
spectrogram text on this album at all. This is why the audio channel is closed for this puzzle
even though the identical toolbox worked on the prior one.

## POAP clock-and-wordlist image (the carrier for this puzzle)

| Hypothesis | Space | Method | Result | Witness | Date |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Word-per-hour read at the numeral centroid plus 1 row (3 candidates per hour), 4 canonical orderings (clockwise, reverse, 12-first clockwise, 12-first counterclockwise) | 1,193,373 combinations tested (132,597 checksum-valid) | BIP44 m/44'/60'/0'/0/0 plus neighbor sweep | 0 match, 131.8 seconds | yes | 2026-07-14 |
| Asymmetric row window (centroid plus or minus 1 row), each of the 4 orderings separately | 531,441 combinations per ordering (about 33,000 checksum-valid each) | same oracle | 0 match | yes | 2026-06-17 |
| Wider asymmetric window refinement (best visual reads with row-aware neighbors) | about 8.6e8 estimated space, sampled rather than exhausted | same oracle | 0 match on the sampled region | yes | 2026-06-17 |
| Exactly one ambiguous hour read at a new `+/-2` wrapped row, with the other 8 ambiguous hours restricted to their prior 3-word sets; wrap widths 169 through 175 and 4 canonical orderings | 1,495,908 combinations (93,069 checksum-valid) | `tools/wider_row_search.py`; target pass split at 10,000, then generator-only coverage replay with matching SHA-256 stream commitments | 0 match in 1,763.054 seconds; measured 932.18 candidates/s, estimated 1,594.007 seconds before the full run | yes (known-good BIP39 KAT re-found through the same candidate check call at head, middle, and tail of both committed segments) | 2026-08-16 |
| Distinct-overlay hypothesis (12 words marked by a different color or intensity) | full image histogram | gray-intensity and hue histogram analysis | refuted: exactly 1 gray text population, only 2 non-gray hue families (the red sunburst spokes, the yellow title and signature); no marking of any kind at any of the 12 numeral positions | yes (direct pixel measurement) | 2026-06-17 |
| Higher-resolution or vector source | prize contract tokenURI, POAP asset server, artist website, album video | direct fetch and comparison | refuted: the 2004x2011 raster in this folder is the finest source found anywhere; the album video is 1080p, lower resolution than the plot | yes | 2026-06-17 |
| Calibration against a known-answer "Bifurcations" POAP | POAP GraphQL query for any drop with "bifurcation" in its name | direct API query | refuted: 0 drops match; no known-answer clock image exists for this artist to reverse-engineer the readout rule from | yes | 2026-06-17 |

## Explicitly not fed to the oracle

Sung lyrics on 2 tracks (DiscomfortMeditation, ShadowRealm) contain several BIP39 wordlist
tokens among their ordinary lyrics. I did not test any permutation of these: no mechanism
selects which 12 of the many lyric tokens would be the seed or in what order, so testing them
would be an unbounded search with no stopping rule, not a bounded hypothesis. This is listed
as untested, not as a negative.

## Summary

Across the POAP-image family, 1,193,373 plus 531,441 times 4 plus the exact 1,495,908-member
single-hour `+/-2` family and a sampled 8.6e8-sized space have been checked, with 0 matches
and 0 partial hits. The clock-and-grid mechanism itself (order from the hour position, word
from the wordlist cell the numeral overlays) is confirmed by 3 hours that read with no row
ambiguity. Remaining variants require either multiple hours to move outside the prior
`+/-1` rows or a different pixel-selection rule; the published 2004-pixel raster does not
resolve either constraint further.
