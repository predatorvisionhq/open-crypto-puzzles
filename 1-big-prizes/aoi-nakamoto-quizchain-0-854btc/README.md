# Aoi Nakamoto Quizchain (0.854 BTC, [OPEN])

AoiNakamoto, a pseudonymous Reddit user, ran a series of roughly 90 self-funded
Bitcoin puzzle blocks from April to October 2019 on r/bitcoinpuzzles and her own
r/Grycoin, each with its own escrow address, question, and prize. She stopped
posting in October 2019 without ever reclaiming her own puzzle funds. Every
block was solved and swept by readers except the last two she published: the
second and final stage of "Real Big Block" (0.777 BTC) and "Quizchain2 Block
76" (0.077 BTC), both still funded seven years later. The MD5-to-BIP39
derivation mechanism is confirmed exactly, including a case-flip rule proven on
a solved sibling lot; what remains is the precise source text for Real Big
Block and a short answer to a word riddle for Block 76.

## The puzzle as published

AoiNakamoto's last two blocks, in order:

Real Big Block stage 1, 2019-07-07
([reddit.com/r/Grycoin/comments/ca6jxv](https://www.reddit.com/r/Grycoin/comments/ca6jxv/77_mbtc_quizchain2_block_77_stage_one/)):
"I do disclose that this one has no TOMI field, but that is all. You are on your
own completely." Its question links to Hal Finney's "Bitcoin and me" post on
bitcointalk (topic 155054). She adds: "I will publish the complete solution as
the Second stage of this block. This solution will in turn be the question for
the Second stage, which will have the final 777 mbtc prize." This stage's
escrow, `19TbyN5KCg1Lg7qHwezifsLVcdSa2Rj5KN`, was solved and swept on
2019-08-03; it is not part of the live prize and is used in this folder only to
certify the case-flip rule (see "What is understood").

Quizchain2 Block 76, 2019-07-22
([reddit.com/r/Grycoin/comments/cgcv9i](https://www.reddit.com/r/Grycoin/comments/cgcv9i/77_mbtc_quizchain2_block_76/)):
"Question: change to", "Format: [solution] TOMI [TOMI]", "First three digits of
MD5 hash are f8e". A later update adds "First two digits of solution only are
1d", and a hint changes the question to "from change to". She adds: "I will
shut down soon now [...] so I will not be available for hints or questions."

Real Big Block stage 2, published as a chapter titled "Second" on the author's
own Wattpad account
([wattpad.com/720888559-second](https://www.wattpad.com/720888559-second)). In
the "Real Big Block Discussion" thread
([reddit.com/r/Grycoin/comments/chn8un](https://www.reddit.com/r/Grycoin/comments/chn8un/real_big_block_discussion/)),
she writes, 2019-07-25: "When I posted the real big block at the Wattpad site,
I added extra line breaks between paragraphs. This information is needed to
solve the block." On 2019-07-31, after moving the funds to the current escrow:
"I took back the prize for a moment and sent it again to a new address, hashing
with a slightly different solution [...] It has multiple paragraphs and two
line breaks between each of them."

## What is understood

### Mechanism

Every block in the series follows the same transform: MD5 the exact bytes of a
source text to get 128 bits of entropy, generate a BIP39 mnemonic from that
entropy, derive BIP44 path `m/44'/0'/0'/0/i` (the author confirms taking a low
index, typically the first), and compare the resulting P2PKH address to the
block's escrow. Block 76 additionally uses a `[solution] TOMI [tomi]` format,
where TOMI (Japanese for "wealth") is a second, separately-hinted field: an
anti-brute-force device, since guessing the solution alone is not enough to
reach the hash.

![Source text to P2PKH address, five stages linked by MD5, BIP39 and BIP44](images/01-pipeline-derivation.svg)
*Figure 1. The MD5-to-address derivation pipeline (source: data/pipeline-stages.json, script tools/fig_pipeline.py), 2026-08-16.*

For Real Big Block, the exact source text is confirmed to be the "Second"
chapter, with a case-flip rule applied to some of its paragraphs, not the
chapter's raw text. This rule is proven on the solved sibling lot Block 77
Stage One: of that post's 16 paragraphs, the 4 whose first letter is not I, T,
A, S or M get their first letter lowercased and their last letter uppercased,
and the paragraphs are joined with a blank line; this reproduces
`19TbyN5KCg1Lg7qHwezifsLVcdSa2Rj5KN` exactly. The "Second" chapter contains the
same paragraph-initial pattern 3 times on its own, plus a quotation from the
Finney post, but no combination of applying the rule to these 4 candidate
groups (nor to the many related selections in `analysis/tested.md`) reproduces
either the current or the superseded Real Big Block address. The Wattpad API
confirms the chapter's `modifyDate` as 2019-07-23T23:12:04Z, 7 days before the
current escrow was funded, so the text available today predates the funding and
is very likely the version that was hashed; what is not settled is which exact
byte sequence the author's own tool read from it, since Wattpad's storage
normalizes away the blank lines she describes typing (see "Open leads").

For Block 76, a community player found, in 2019, that `solution = "format"`,
`tomi = "before TOMI"` satisfies both published MD5-prefix hints (`1d` and
`f8e`); the free filter for checking this yourself is
`tools/oracle.py --block76-filter`. No standard derivation of this pair reaches
the escrow address, and the author never corrected the block after the pair was
posted publicly, which argues this chain is a coincidental false positive
rather than her real answer (see "What has been tested").

### Derivation and oracle

```
python3 tools/oracle.py --selftest
python3 tools/oracle.py "<candidate text>"
python3 tools/oracle.py --stdin
python3 tools/oracle.py --block76-filter "<solution>" "<tomi>"
python3 tools/oracle.py --flip-case "<one paragraph>"
```

Given a candidate text, the oracle MD5s its UTF-8 bytes, derives BIP44 indices 0
through 5, and compares each resulting address against both open escrows.
`--block76-filter` checks the 2 free MD5-prefix hints before any derivation.
`--flip-case` applies the confirmed Stage One rule to one paragraph you supply.
This script ships no source text of its own: Real Big Block's source (a Wattpad
chapter) and the Stage One certification text (a bitcointalk post by Hal
Finney) are both excluded, the first as bulk chapter content and the second as
third-party historical material neither the puzzle's author nor this repository
holds the rights to. Supply your own candidate text to test it.

### Certified against

`tools/oracle.py --selftest` reproduces the author's own published calibration
vector, given in the round-1 corpus: entropy `2941774a2abec9f30c7d6777d1d53d91`,
at BIP44 index 1 ("my 2nd private key"), derives WIF
`L5Z66qPmUkTAsWQywjRNHDxHrX6J1X1SQedp6V8QsbaXR7rGd6ex` exactly, and that WIF
appears at no other index. This certifies the MD5-to-address transform itself,
without needing any third-party text. The selftest also checks the
`--flip-case` helper against a synthetic (non-puzzle) example sentence, and the
`--block76-filter` helper against the community-found `format` / `before TOMI`
pair.

This does not, by itself, reproduce Block 77 Stage One end to end, since that
needs Hal Finney's bitcointalk post text, which this repository does not ship.
Anyone who supplies that text (freely readable at bitcointalk topic 155054) can
reproduce it themselves with `apply_stage_one_rule()` in `tools/oracle.py`; I
did this during research and it reproduces `19TbyN5KCg1Lg7qHwezifsLVcdSa2Rj5KN`
exactly, which is the basis for the case-flip rule described above.

Reproduced 2026-08-16.

### Established facts

1. Both escrows are funded and unspent as of 2026-08-16: `14zMkTgaVXJcxdh4JdWi29MLRR44iUSG9W`
   holds 0.777 BTC (funded 2019-07-30, block 587833) and
   `13Cv6SXUnzGDT8JHqzzJ8xMPtsSdhJA4wd` holds 0.077 BTC (funded 2019-07-22,
   block 586468), checked via [mempool.space](https://mempool.space).
2. Across the approximately 90 blocks of the series, these are the only 2 still
   funded: an exhaustive sweep of all 159 funding transactions cited in the
   author's 202 Reddit posts found 0 unreadable transactions and exactly these
   2 unspent above 100,000 sats.
3. The MD5-to-BIP39-to-BIP44 transform is confirmed exactly against the
   author's own published calibration vector (above).
4. The case-flip rule is confirmed exactly against the solved sibling lot Block
   77 Stage One (above), reproducing its escrow address byte for byte.
5. The Real Big Block chapter's Wattpad `modifyDate` (2019-07-23) predates the
   current escrow's funding (2019-07-30) by 7 days, and the chapter has not
   been modified since, confirmed via the Wattpad API.
6. No archived capture of the "Second" Wattpad chapter from 2019 exists on the
   Wayback Machine, archive.today, or Common Crawl, checked across 8 URL forms
   and 5 time-windowed collections; a positive control query on each service
   confirms the services themselves were responding, so these are true absences
   in the archive, not failed lookups.
7. The chain `MD5("format") ` starts with `1d` and `MD5("format TOMI before TOMI")`
   starts with `f8e`, matching both prefixes the author published for Block 76;
   neither of 2 other independently solved calibration blocks (73 and 74) shows
   any sign this chain is the author's real answer.

## Open leads, ranked

1. **Reconstruct the 2019 browser-copy rendering of the Wattpad chapter**
   (hours). The chapter's API storage today has no blank paragraphs, but the
   author describes typing 2 line breaks between paragraphs; Wattpad likely
   normalized this away, and what she hashed was probably what her browser
   rendered and she copied in 2019, not today's raw storage. Confirmed by
   re-testing the already-tried paragraph selections against a faithfully
   reconstructed 2019 rendering; killed if that still does not match.
2. **Read the 27 posts and comments between the rehash and the shutdown**
   (about an hour). The author posted 2019-07-30 to 2019-08-04 before going
   silent; these have been read once for an explicit hint but not re-read
   systematically against the now-narrower list of untested paragraph
   combinations. Confirmed by a new detail that, applied and tested, matches;
   killed by a full re-read producing nothing new.
3. **A bounded 2-character-edit sweep on the strongest base texts** (about an
   hour on a rented GPU). The 1-character sweep is exhaustive; a 2-character
   sweep restricted to the small set of NBSP and line-ending pairs, rather than
   every position, is a bounded extension. Confirmed by a match in that bounded
   space; killed by exhausting it with none.
4. **Identify what "76" indexes for Block 76** (minutes per candidate corpus).
   A method confirmed on 3 sibling blocks uses the block number as a position
   index into a specific numbered corpus; every corpus tried so far does not
   contain "change" at position 76. The author's chronological r/Grycoin
   submission corpus is closed: its exact position-76 pair was negative, and
   its self-post subset has only 71 records. Remaining candidates include a
   fuller archive of Hal Finney's tweets and Satoshi's SourceForge posts.
5. **A short, human-reasoned answer to "change to" / "from change to"**
   (minutes per candidate). The author's confirmed style elsewhere in the
   series favors short, punchy wordplay answers over long dictionary phrases; a
   free filter (`tools/oracle.py --block76-filter`) checks any candidate in
   under a second before a full derivation. This lead has no exhaustion
   condition; it is a standing invitation, same as any human-reasoned wordplay
   block in the series.
