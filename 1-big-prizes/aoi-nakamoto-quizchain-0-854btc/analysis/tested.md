# Tested hypotheses, full ledger

Summary table is in the README. This file has the full detail behind each row.
All figures are re-read from the private research's own dated result logs before

## Real Big Block (0.777 BTC)

The mechanism is certified (the case-flip rule reproduces the solved sibling lot
Block 77 Stage One exactly). What is not established is exactly which paragraphs
of the "Second" chapter the author modified on 2019-07-30, and the precise text
she copied. Every row below tests a specific hypothesis about that, against both
the current escrow (`14zMkTgaVXJcxdh4JdWi29MLRR44iUSG9W`) and its superseded
predecessor (`1EFojcAo2vbhRGCGCa7q8Wwvzss28mhQYC`).

| Hypothesis family | Candidates | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Chapter unmodified, every plausible serialization (line-break style, encoding) | approximately 150,000 | 0 match |
| Certified case-flip rule applied to the 3 planted paragraph groups plus the Finney quote, 16 combinations, both letter-position modes | approximately 200,000 | 0 match |
| Every subset of the 17 candidate paragraphs (2^17), 18 serialization variants | 2,360,000 | 0 match |
| Paragraphs selected by a name or word ("Satoshi", "Aoi Nakamoto", "Hal Finney", "Grycoin", and 7 more), by first letter or first character | approximately 10,000 | 0 match |
| Every paragraph starting with F or W (and F, W, H) | approximately 1,000 | 0 match |
| The certified groups plus one arbitrary extra paragraph | 13,000 | 0 match |
| The certified groups plus two arbitrary extra paragraphs | approximately 600,000 | 0 match |
| The single-word planted correction from block 29 ("voice" to "vOIce"), alone and combined with the groups | 6,000 | 0 match |
| Block-29-style link suffixes appended to the text | 8,000 | 0 match |
| Chapter subsections read alone | 3,000 | 0 match |
| Page-level prefixes (duplicated title, author byline) | 2,000 | 0 match |
| A simulated Chromium browser copy (selection/innerText rendering rules) | 1,000 | 0 match |
| Alternate text encodings (Latin-1, UTF-16, cp1252, NBSP normalization) | 3,000 | 0 match |
| Simulated-browser-copy base combined with the name/word selectors, then with all 2^17 paragraph subsets | approximately 800,000 | 0 match |
| A single invisible character (BOM, zero-width space, tab, and 6 more) inserted at the start or end | 5,000 | 0 match |
| Paragraphs selected by the letters of "Satoshi Nakamoto" specifically (a refinement of the name-selector row above, after finding the Finney post has a paragraph starting with M) | 60 | 0 match |
| Last-letter-only or first-letter-only variants of the case-flip rule, on the certified groups | 456 texts (2,736 address checks across derivation indices) | 0 match |
| All of the above serialization families repeated under CRLF line endings | 2,448 texts (14,688 address checks) | 0 match |
| 1 to 3 single-letter case toggles across all sign positions, and 1 to 2 across all paragraph boundaries | 1,450,000 | 0 match |
| Every single-character edit (insert, delete, replace, case toggle) at every position, across 40 base texts (5 paragraph-set choices x 2 NBSP conventions x 2 line-ending conventions x 2 separator conventions) | 266,038,400 | 0 match |

Witness status: every row above used the oracle certified against Block 77 Stage
One (see README, "Certified against"); the single-character-edit row additionally
planted 3 synthetic witnesses per base text (head, middle, tail) and recovered
all of them on all 40 bases, plus recovered the real Stage One text and address
when run as a 41st base. Dates: all rows 2026-08-15.

Cumulative for Real Big Block: approximately 272 million candidates tested, 0
match. The single-character-edit sweep accounts for the large majority of this
total and is the only row certified as a complete sweep of its stated space (all
40 bases, every single edit); every other row is a targeted, not exhaustive,
test of one specific hypothesis about which paragraphs were modified.

## Quizchain2 Block 76 (0.077 BTC)

The chain a community player found in 2019 (`solution = "format"`,
`TOMI = "before TOMI"`) satisfies both of the author's published MD5-prefix
hints, but no standard BIP44/49/84 derivation, derivation path, or passphrase
variant of it produces the escrow address. Two later calibration checks (blocks
73 and 74, both already solved and swept, not part of the live prize) confirm
the derivation code itself is correct, and a later cross-check on 2019-07-29
comment timing suggests the "format" chain was itself a false positive found by
searching for strings that pass the 2 published prefixes, rather than the
author's real answer, since the author never corrected the block after seeing it
posted publicly (see README).

Standard-derivation sweep on the `format`/`before TOMI` chain:

| Hypothesis family | Candidates | Result |
|---|---|---|
| BIP44, BIP49, BIP84, accounts 0 to 4, external and internal chains, index 0 to 199 (BIP44 external: 0 to 1999) | standard derivation space | 0 match |
| Non-standard derivation paths (Coleman-style m/0'/0/i, m/0/i, m/0', root key) | small, enumerated | 0 match |
| Passphrase variants ("TOMI", "format", "before TOMI", bracket and whitespace forms) | small, enumerated | 0 match |
| Alternate entropy functions (SHA-256 as a 24-word mnemonic, SHA-1, RIPEMD-160, truncated SHA-512, double MD5) | small, enumerated | 0 match |
| Off-by-one word at BIP39 import (12 positions x 2,047 alternate words each) | 24,564 | 0 match |
| Word order reversed | 1 | 0 match |

Word-transform "salves" on the question "change to" / "from change to" (each
family's candidate solution strings tested through the same 2 MD5-prefix filters
before any derivation; only pairs passing both filters were derivation-tested):

| Salve | Candidate solutions | Passed prefix 1d | Passed both filters (derivation-tested) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Single-letter edits, anagrams, Atbash/ROT/foldover, translations of "change" | 7,730 | 32 | 3,506 TOMI pairs, 0 match |
| WordNet synsets and hyper/hyponyms of change/alter | 20,199 | 74 | 8,806 TOMI pairs, 0 match |
| Wikipedia article titles containing "change" | 14,666 | 44 | 4,949 TOMI pairs, 0 match |
| Sentences from Satoshi/Hal Finney bitcointalk posts and emails containing "change to" | 46 | 0 | n/a |
| Sentences from bitcointalk posts numbered 60 to 94 (2 orderings) | 1,992 | 11 (noise) | n/a |
| Strings built from the number 76 (years, technical constants, ordinals) | 3,779 | 23 (noise) | n/a |
| Encodings of "change" (hex, base64, NATO alphabet, Morse, keyboard shift) | approximately 130 | 1 (noise) | n/a |
| "changeto" (no space) combined with TOMI variants | 1 | 1 | 1,701 TOMI pairs, 0 match |
| Every address and txid from the author's 158 other funding transactions | approximately 1,500 | 4 (case noise) | n/a |
| Renaming candidates ("wealth", "legacy", and similar) | 45 | 0 | n/a |
| An Easter/resurrection word family, echoing the same block number in round 1 | 2,752 | 17 (noise) | 5,857 TOMI pairs, 0 match |
| Halving-related terms | 45 | 1 (noise) | n/a |
| Grycoin/burn-address/second-layer terms from the chapter | 60 | 0 | n/a |
| Literal strings and typos from the block's own post | 45 | 0 | n/a |

A separate "post-number-as-index" method, confirmed on 3 other blocks in the
series (numbers 56, 57 and 58 each index a specific post or tweet by Satoshi or
Hal Finney, by position), does not carry over to block 76: post number 76 in
every corpus and ordering tried (Satoshi's bitcointalk posts newest-first and
chronological, Hal Finney's posts, Hal Finney's tweets) contains neither "change"
nor "from".

2026-08-16 bounded index check:

| Corpus definition | Records | Position-76 result | Candidates | Result |
|---|---:|---|---:|---|
| Every chronological submission object by AoiNakamoto in r/Grycoin, including cross-posts | 87 | `ce4ixs`, "[8 mbtc] Quizchain2 Block 71" | 1 published answer/TOMI pair | 0 match |
| The same sequence restricted to self-posts (`is_self = true`) | 71 | no position 76 | 0 | n/a |

The public recovery query was
`https://api.pullpush.io/reddit/search/submission/?author=AoiNakamoto&subreddit=Grycoin&sort=asc&sort_type=created_utc&size=100`;
the final page beginning with Block 73 returned 10 records (Block 73 plus the
last nine), establishing the 87-record extent. The selected Block-71 record
supplies its already-published answer pair; its solution MD5 is
`4818b1f815b8ea5aebe4c0112180b64a` (not `1d`) and its formatted-string MD5 is
`4bcacee7f46c6dcb96531b8137d4688f` (not `f8e`). Its published pair was first
run through `--block76-filter`, then through the certified standard address
oracle: 0 match.

Before the one-candidate address run, the real `tools/oracle.py` took 0.78 s
per candidate (D = 1.28 candidates/s), so N = 1 gave t = 0.78 s, well below
two hours. `tools/oracle.py --selftest` passed immediately beforehand. The
self-post-only interpretation has N = 0, so no solver or address run was
created for it.

The exact wording lead adds no further deterministic solution corpus. The
published question says `change to`; its update says to change it "from
'change to' to 'from change to'"; and the author's direct reply to the public
question "to or two?" is "to." This resolves spelling only, not an answer or
TOMI field. Literal source strings were already covered by the existing
45-string row, so no candidate was repeated (N = 0).

A large dictionary-times-corpus sweep tested every 1-to-4-word phrase built from
the author's own writing (Reddit posts, comments, and Wattpad chapters) as a
candidate TOMI value, against a dictionary-and-WordNet-derived candidate solution
list: 189,565 candidate solutions passing the first filter, times 656,845 to
1,250,000 candidate TOMI phrases depending on the pass, for a combined total of
approximately 3.2x10^11 MD5 computations and approximately 78 million full
address derivations on the pairs that passed both filters. 0 match. The
derivation code was re-confirmed correct on both calibration blocks (73 and 74)
at the head, middle and tail of this run.

Cumulative for Block 76: approximately 78 million address derivations from the
scripted dictionary sweep, plus approximately 53,000 smaller thematic candidates
across the 14 salves above, plus the full standard-derivation sweep on the one
chain found by search. 0 match anywhere. This is reported as a targeted, not
exhaustive, negative: the true solution may use vocabulary outside the corpora
swept (the author's own writing and 2 general-purpose dictionaries), and the
block may simply be misconfigured (see README).
